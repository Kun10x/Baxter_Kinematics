# Kinematics

# Forward Kinematics

Generally, the Forward Kinematics (FPK) is given by the joint values (theta values) to calculate the pose includes position and orientation of end-effector (Baxter's gripper is end-effector)

**Given:** $$(\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3,\theta_4,\theta_5,\theta_6)$$

**Calculate**: $$\left[ _{7}^{0}T \right] and \left[ _{G}^{W}T \right]$$

**Where** : {G} is the left-arm end-effector(gripper) frame and {W} is the World fixed reference frame on the floor.
